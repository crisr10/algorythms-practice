# Algorithms Practice

I am currently working on [The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure) by Stephen Grider and this is where I'm storing all of the algorithms we work on. 

This is a very thorough Udemy course and Stephen is a great teacher. Great course to get better at algorithms and data structures.
